My experiment with using Cursor to 'vibe code' a game. 90% of the code, all graphics, sound effects and music were generated by AI.

This is the product of about a day's work and using all 150 of the free fast requests I got as part of the Cursor trial and I had such a blast!!

I was impressed how I started the project by having all the code in `Main.ts` and after I had a moving ship was able to direct the AI to start putting logic into discrete states. After I had described some kind of state management system I was able to then describe how I wanted certain features to be compartmentalised into systems. After that I was able to add a menu without the menu code getting mixed up with the game. I was able to direct the AI to abstract the input system so after I had a working game I was able to add touch controls and gamepad support. Well I say 'I' but really the AI was doing the heavy lifting!! As a bonus I was able to direct the AI to add an audio system and keep it self contained without the audio/music code leaking directly into the menu and play states.

Some of the game logic such as scoring has ended up in weird places but I think with some prompting this could be ironed out in a flash... but I ran out of requests :-(

I think I would have got better results if I had planned a code structure from the start and gave direction but the ability to make it up as I went along and mould it into something semi coherent without having to get hands on with the actual code I thought was amazing.

The rest of this `README.md` is generated by the AI (the one who did the actual work!)
